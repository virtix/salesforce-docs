SoftWare Advisory Group (SWAG)
=======================
The SWAG is a peer-group of software and technology experts who will define and guide strategies and decisions for software products and key delivery platforms; e.g., ConsumerFinance.gov.   All technologies and software product implementations will be reviewed by this group and approved by the Software Development Lead in order to ensure alignment with D&D and T&I architectures and strategy.  This group will equally serve as a panel of experts to help solve challenging technical issues and support teamsâ€™ goals and objectives throughout the life of the product.
