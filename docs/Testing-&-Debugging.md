####Testing

(NOTE:  http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer//apexcode/Content/apex_testing_best_practices.htm)

The following principles apply to unit testing Apex code

1. Cover as many lines of code as possible

* Salesforce requires that you have at least 75% of your Apex scripts covered by unit tests to deploy your scripts to production environments. In addition, all triggers should have some test coverage.

* Salesforce recommends that you have 100% of your scripts covered by unit tests, where possible.

* In order for a project team to deploy to production at CFPB, it is required that ALL classes and triggers have at least 90% covered by unit tests in order to deploy to production through the release management process.

2. In the case of conditional logic (including ternary operators), execute each branch of code logic.

3. Make calls to methods using both valid and invalid inputs.

4. Complete successfully without throwing any exceptions, unless those errors are expected and caught in a try…catch block.

5. Always handle all exceptions that are caught, instead of merely catching the exceptions.

6. Use ```System.assert``` methods to prove that code behaves as expected. 

7. Use the ```runAs``` method to test your application in different user contexts.

8. Use the isTest annotation. Classes defined with the isTest annotation do not count against your organization limit of 1 MB for all Apex scripts.

9. Exercise bulk trigger functionality—use at least 201 records in your tests.

10. Write comments stating not only what is supposed to be tested, but the assumptions the tester made about the data, the expected outcome, and so on.

11. Debug statements and Comments are not included in the Code coverage.

12. User records are not covered by test methods.

13. Web service calls should be tested using a Mock class.

14. Large amounts of test data should be loaded by using the Test.loadData.

15. Never use @seeAllData.  Accessing data specific to a sandbox can result in deployments failing

16. Do not write test classes merely to get code coverage. It is much more effective to write the test code to cover specific business cases. You will find that if you use this method you will cover much more code, much faster than just writing test code to get coverage only. Additionally this will help ensure that you are meeting the business requirements in addition to testing for bugs. 

####Debugging

Unlike traditional languages such as Java, C++, and C#, Apex and Visualforce can be quite cumbersome and time consuming when trying to debug. You don’t have the luxury of being able to step through the code during runtime. 

Instead of having the ability to set breakpoints and halt execution of the code, you must instead use logging to capture the flow of events to help you troubleshoot the code.

Salesforce a debug log that allows you to output string or even deserialize objects to help you understand what the value of specific complex variables were at specific times during runtime. 

Take a look at the example below. Take note of the line highlighted in yellow. This statement when executed will write a log entry to the Salesforce debug log that you can later view by going to the developer’s console.

```java
public with sharing class SampleClass
{
    public List<Account> getLeads(Date CreatedDate)
    {
         List<Lead> = leads = [SELECT id,FirstName,LastName FROM Lead WHERE CreatedDate =: CreatedDate];

         System.Debug(‘Leads Retrieved: ‘ + leads);
    }
} 
```

While writing apex code you should always make sure to add debug statements in key areas of your code that would help in debugging should errors occur. 

Take a look at the example below that expands our example above.

```java
public with sharing class SampleClass
{
    public List<Account> getLeads(Date CreatedDate)
    {
         List<Lead> = leads = [SELECT id,FirstName,LastName FROM Lead WHERE CreatedDate =: CreatedDate];

         System.Debug(‘Leads Retrieved: ‘ + leads);
    }

    public List<Account> updateLeads(List<Lead> leads)
    {
        try
        {
            insert leads;
        }
        catch(DMLException e)
        {
            System.Debug(‘An error occurred while inserting leads. Exception: ‘ + e.getLineNumber() + ‘:’ + getStackTraceString);

        } 

    }

} 
```

Notice in the code above that we have added a new method to update our lead records and have added a try/catch block to catch an exception that has occurred. 

Adding debug statements within the catch block is an excellent way to help troubleshooting issues in the future.
