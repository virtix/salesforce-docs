- **Go Live Review** - for completed systems and releases prior to production deployment
- **Change Request (CR) Review** - for changes to production applications / features or approved plans / processes

###Responsibilities

The COE is responsible for making project-level tactical decisions for applications deployed to the Bureau’s Salesforce platform that support the strategic direction established by the Chief Information Officer in line with the Bureau’s Strategic Plan. 

The COE shall be responsible for the following activities, organized by primary function:

- Go Live Review:
    - Validate that necessary activities prescribed by the EP COE process have been completed
    - Grant authority to move a system to Production (“Go-Live”) on one of the Bureau’s enterprise platforms (will still require T&I Project Gate 2 review and approval prior to release)

###COE Administration

Normal COE meetings will be held on a weekly basis. If there are no items for review, COE meetings will be canceled at the discretion of the COE Chair.  Additional meetings may also be scheduled at the Chair’s discretion to handle a high volume of agenda items.  

The COE Facilitator is responsible for maintaining calendar invites, reserving rooms, setting up WebEx or conference bridges, taking requests for agenda time, recording meeting attendance, and documenting / posting meeting minutes.  The COE Facilitator will prepare an agenda for each COE meeting.  Items to be considered for a COE meeting must be submitted to the Facilitator no later than one hour prior to the meeting.  See request agenda request form here.  

Links to the COE agendas and meeting minutes can be accessed through the T&I Enterprise Platforms team Google Documents collection.

###Decisions

- **New Solution Review** 
    New solution concepts will be introduced at COE meetings by Platform Business Analysts (BA) who will be expected to present high-level requirements and the analysis conducted (Project Detail, Fit Gap Analysis) to make a platform decision to the COE. After each new solution concept is discussed, a vote will be taken to **approve, defer, or disapprove** the proposed item.  The EP Program team will work with the business line(s) involved and T&I PMO to review scheduling, resources, and budget for the new solution request. 

- **Design Review** 
    In order for an application or set of requirements to proceed to a development sprint or development contract, they must first go through a design review with the Platform Software Advisory Group (SwAG).  The COE may decide to **approve or disapprove design** based on recommendation from the SwAG and Principal Platform Architect. 

- **Go Live Review** 
    Prior to a new or updated platform release being approved for deployment to a production environment it must undergo a Go Live Review.  The Go Live Review is driven by a Go Live checklist for the project / iteration and will happen prior to the T&I PMO Gate 2 review.  The COE will vote to **approve go live, disapprove go live** as is, or **approve go live contingent** upon an ensuing task.  For the latter decision, the approval will be considered to take effect once the contingent action is fulfilled.

- **Change Requests (CRs)**
    CRs will be introduced to the COE by the product project teams or support and operations groups (e.g., centralized O&M team or app-specific groups). The COE will review the business justification for the CR submitted. At the conclusion of the CR review, the COE will **approve, disapprove, or defer** the CR.  The COE Facilitator will notify the product manager and business owner and the T&I CCB (if required by threshold criteria). 

- **Emergency Requests**
    A virtual COE vote will be held for **only** emergency requests.  The virtual voting process will follow the normal COE process except that no actual meeting will be held and voting will be conducted through email.  

    The COE will be responsible for:

    - Validating that the request is an actual emergency 
    - Ensuring that no action is taken in the event that a quorum is not reached
    - Recording the decision
    - Ensuring that each emergency request is processed in a timely manner

- **Quorum Requirement**
    COE members are expected to participate in each meeting.  In order for the outcome of a COE vote to be official there must be a minimum of three voting members present (in person or remotely via WebEx or conference call), including a COE Chair or Alternate COE Chair.  In the event that neither the official COE Chair or Alternate Chair may be present, they may each designate in writing a secondary alternate who may fulfill the quorum requirement in their absence.  Note that only government employees may be voting members or COE Chairs. 

    When a quorum is present, COE decisions will be based on a majority vote of the present voting COE members. In the event of a tie, the COE Chair will exercise executive decision making authority to approve, defer, or disapprove the decision.

    The COE Chair has the authority to veto all decisions, though in cases where a veto goes against the majority the rationale for the veto must be documented.   All change requests, excluding Emergency Change Requests, will be voted on during the weekly COE Meetings. If a quorum is not present, voting will be deferred until the next COE meeting. 

- **Supporting Tool(s)**
    Change Requests will be tracked in the Remedyforce application and any changes that elevate to the level of a CCB review will also be tracked in the Bureau’s Redmine Tool.  

###Changes to the Charter
Any proposed changes to this COE Charter may be reviewed and approved as a standard CR.  This charter will be reviewed annually or as required.  Any necessary revisions will be made and tracked via the charter revision history.
